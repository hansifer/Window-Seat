## Make browser windows open at a consistent position and size

### The problem

<img height="152" align="left" src="http://hansifer.com/hosted-assets/window-seat/cascaded-windows-6.png"><br>
Browser windows sometimes don't open at the desired position, size, or state. For example, new windows may "cascade". New windows may also fail to receive focus.

### The solution
<br>

**Window Seat** makes every new browser window consistently appear at the desired position, size, and state and ensures that the window gets focused when it opens.
